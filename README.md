# Vanguard CX A/B Test , Is a UI Redesign Worth It?

>  **Team project (Ironhack). My role:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing (two-proportion z-test + confidence intervals), and business recommendations.

We tested a new UI for Vanguard to see if it actually improves customer experience.  
**KPIs:** Completion Rate, Error Rate, Time per Step.  
**Business bar:** +5% completion uplift.

## Preview

### Who is the client?
Vanguard is one of the world‚Äôs most respected investment management companies.

### Business case
Vanguard considered redesigning its onboarding UI to make the process smoother and encourage higher client conversion.  
**Key question:** *Is the redesign worth the investment?*

### Data pipeline
We collected four datasets, cleaned and merged them into one.  
Steps included: renaming columns, removing duplicates/invalid values, and dropping nulls in key variables.

### Are groups comparable? (EDA)
Control and Test groups had similar demographics.  
- Age ~48 years on average  
- Tenure mostly 5‚Äì15 years  
- Gender distribution balanced  

This means the A/B test is valid and representative.

### One key result
‚úÖ Completion improved (+3.7 pp).  
‚ùå Error rate also increased (+3.4 pp).  

Users finished more often, but with more mistakes.

## Results in numbers

| Metric       | Control | Test | Œî (Test ‚Äì Control) |
|--------------|---------|------|--------------------|
| Completion % | 65.6    | 69.3 | +3.7 pp            |
| Error rate % | 34.4    | 37.8 | +3.4 pp            |
| Avg. time    | Mixed   | Mixed| Faster at Step 2 & 3, slower at Confirm |

## Hypothesis testing

- **Null (H0):** No improvement in completion.  
- **Alt (H1):** Test has higher completion.  
- **Result:** Statistically significant (p < 0.001).  
- **But:** Business threshold of +5% uplift was not reached.  

---

## Recommendations

1. Do not roll out the redesign fully yet.  
2. Optimize **Step 1** and **Confirm page** (too slow, more hesitation).  
3. Keep the improvements from Step 2 and Step 3.  
4. Re-run the experiment after fixes.
